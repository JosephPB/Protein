# Protein
## Introduction
Proteins fold into biologically 'active' states which allow them to perform important tasks. Whether or not they can perform this task is dependent on their folded structure, and if they are not in the correct 'active' state, then they are considered 'dead'. A build up of 'dead' proteins in the body is not just inefficient, it can also be harmful to the bodies function. Therefore, understanding the folding of these structures is crucial, to academic biolgists, as well as companies designing productes whic may interact with proteins.

This model simulates the folding of a randomly generated protein, given certain input parameters (length, temperature of solution, interaction energies etc.) on an infinite lattice.
